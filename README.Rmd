# datafile

<!-- badges: end -->


The datafile package is build around the philosophy that data should
be separated from code. This means that data is always written to a
different location (directory) than your current working directory,
which contains the code.

## Installation

You can install the github version of this package with

```{r,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jspijker/datafile")
```

## Basic Example

In this example we create a 'data' directory using `datafileInit()`.The
default location is to create a data directory under the current working
directory.  You can create this data directory at any location and for
reproducibility we use the system temporary directory.  Then we create
some variable `x`. Using saveRDS and datafile we save it to disk. The
final RDS file is now saved to `/tmp/Rtmp[.....]/data/x.rds`.


```{r}
library(datafile)
datafileInit(basedir=tempdir()) 
x<-rnorm(10)
saveRDS(x,datafile("x.rds"))

```
To retrieve the rds file, we use:

```{r}
x<-readRDS(datafile("x.rds"))
```

If `datafile` is to much typing for you, you can use the alias
`dfn()`, which stands for 'data file name'.

```{r}
x<-readRDS(dfn("x.rds"))

```

Please see the vignette for more examples how to use this package()

```{r,echo=FALSE}
unlink("./data/",recursive=TRUE)
```
